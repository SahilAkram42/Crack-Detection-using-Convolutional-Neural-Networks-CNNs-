developed a comprehensive project aimed at image classification. This project encompasses various stages, starting from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction. Initially, it generates structured DataFrames by processing images from positive and negative directories, followed by merging and shuffling the data for uniform distribution. Subsequently, it divides the dataset into training and testing subsets and configures TensorFlow's Keras to handle image data generation efficiently. The project culminates in defining, training, and assessing the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurate classification. Furthermore, it includes functionalities for testing new data and predicting labels for random images, ensuring a robust and versatile solution.
